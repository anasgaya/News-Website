    Social work is the helping profession. The primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and help meet basic and complex needs of all people, with a particular focus on those who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty.
    Social Workers listen to people's needs, from young children to people struggling with addictions, and help them to cope and improve their quality of life. This course has enabled me to understand how to make a positive impact in society and has made me aware of how quickly your circumstances in life can change.
    During the 1990s, Khan also served as UNICEF's Special Representative for Sports and promoted health and immunisation programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
